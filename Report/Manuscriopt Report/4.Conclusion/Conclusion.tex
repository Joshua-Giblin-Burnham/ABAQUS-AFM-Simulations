Our FEM approach has demonstrated some novel and varied applications for the analysis of AFM imaging. Our analysis of the contact models for elastic half-spaces and spheres agreed with the theoretical models. Most prominently, the results highlight the under-fitting of the elastic modulus produced by simple Hertzian models for spherical samples. Moreover, our novel formulation of the Double Contact model for conical indenters demonstrated good predictive power over a range of surface radii.  

 Moreover, applying FEM to analyse the compression of hemispheres and simple periodic surfaces highlighted the quantitative power of this approach. These simulations highlighted the dependency of the elastic behaviour on the contact radius and tip convolution. Our results indicated that larger indenters require larger forces to compress the sample to the same extent. In addition, Fourier analysis of the simulated AFM contours elucidated a possible novel trend that larger indentation forces recover more of a surface's periodicity.
