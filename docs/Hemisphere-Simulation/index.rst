To establish how AFM measures the topography and nanomechanics of simple geometries, we probed imaging of elastic hemispheres. Simulations focused on the perceived compression of the structure's central scanline. The spherical/cylindrical structures model the two-dimensional compression of DNA imaging along the transverse axis The hemisphere is modelled as a three-dimensional elastic part in ABAQUS with a fixed, rigid base beneath. Unlike the indentation of a full sphere with a single contact point at the base, the fixed base of a hemisphere alleviates the compression of the surface.
